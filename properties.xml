<!-- NOTE: Use ${stf.basedir.converted} for files located relative
     to the 'stf' system directory. -->

<!-- NOTE: It is an Ant convention that Ant-style property references
     in property values, e.g., "${stf.basedir.converted}", will
     resolve to that property's value, provided the property was
     previously declared either earlier in the build process or
     earlier in the current property file. -->
